        Education & nutrition for 100 children in Ecuador</a> aim to provide local teachers and daily food and fruit in some of the poorest rural communities in Ecuador where finding enough money to feed the family is as much as they can afford. We believe we can get more children into further education through the support of generous donors.</p>
